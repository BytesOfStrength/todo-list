# Todo-list App
Description: This App is to create a Todo-list for weekly assignments. It is a single page application that is built using React and Vite. This application is used to develop lists. 

## Installation and Setup of Project: 

1. Clone the repository using : ```git clone git@github.com:BytesOfStrength/todo-list.git```

2. Go to Cloned Project Directory on your local machine: 

   `cd todo-list`

3. Use React Template in your current project directory:
   `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react`

4. Install dependencies: 
   `npm install`

5. (optional)
   While optional, I used both ESLint and Prettier Configurations to write the code. 
   For EsLint Extension to use with React Project: In the terminal of your project directory (todo list) type: 

`npm install eslint-plugin-react --save-dev`

For Prettier Extension to use with React Project: In the terminal of your project directory (todo-list) type:

`npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier`

## How to Run the Developmental Server
   In your folder for your React project's terminal command line type: 
   `npm run dev`
